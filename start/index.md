## Start a Chapter!

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDOQf1iUgAAx4-C.png)

Ready to start a Maptime chapter for your city? If you know the process already, [jump to the sign up form](#start-form). Otherwise, here's how we get you going:

1. __Create a chapter repo.__ We'll create a [repository on Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#repository) for you so we'll need a list of admins that will be regularly contributing to your pages. Admins should have a Github account so we can add them to a team. Your team will have __write access__ to your repository.

1. __Chapter details.__ Next, you'll send us details about your chapter in the form below. In it, please include:
- __Your Maptime Name.__ Example: MaptimeDC
- __Admins.__ Github usernames
- __Location.__ This gets added to the [map](https://github.com/maptime/maptime.github.io/blob/master/_data/chapters.json).
- __Optional info.__ Twitter handle, meetup.com site, or other links you wish to share.

1. __Get Started with Starter.__ Once your repo is ready, we create a copy of our [Starter template](https://github.com/maptime/starter) for you. It's a great way to get up and running with a your site where you can create posts and events.
