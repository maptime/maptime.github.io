One week ago marked the beginning of what would be a transformational experience at State of the Map, The conference was filled with so many great people drawn together by their love of maps and Open Street Map in particular. 

Although I studied digital map design in grad school (mapping fruit trees on an Android), the focus required using the Google Maps API. That is but one of many ways to create a map, and even more ways to visualize data.  The path of learning mapmaking is in many ways just beginning. Starting here.
