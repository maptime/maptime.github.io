<h2>Lessons and Resources</h2>
<p>Part of opening the doors to cartographic possibility includes pointing to some helpful educational materials. Some of these we make on our own, and others we reference from the vast universe of the internet. That's where so many of us got stuck trying to make web maps on our own, which is why so many of us have gravitated towards Maptime in the first place!</p>

<p>Listed here is a collection of tutorials and slides presented by various Maptime chapters as well as external resources for learning. Have one you'd like to add? Submit an issue <a href="https://github.com/maptime/maptime.github.io/issues/new">here</a> to get it included!</p>

{% assign tutorials = site.data.tutorials | sort:"tags" %}
{% for tutorial in tutorials %}
  <li>
  	<strong><a href="{{ tutorial.link }}">{{tutorial.name}}</a></strong> {{tutorial.description}}
	</li>
{% endfor %}
